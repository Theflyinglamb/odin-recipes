    <h1>Steps</h1>

<ol>
    <li>First things first, you're gonna want to make sure you didn't leave the milk in the cabinet again. If so, head on down to the nearest crack-head infested 7-11 and get yourself a $6.25 gallon of milk.</li>
    <li>Next you're gonna pour the cereal into the bowl, or whatever you have readily avaliable.</li>
    <li>Then, with your brand new, and extremely overpriced gallon of milk. You pour the milk into the bowl.</li>
    <li>This next step is crutial, and one i've slipped up on a few times myself. You're gonna want to take the spoon (not a fork) and place it in the bowl (<em>not</em> a blender).</li>
    <li>Enjoy :}</li>
</ol>
