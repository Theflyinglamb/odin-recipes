    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil water <br> 
        While the water is heating up, go ahead and start chopping your onions. You can dice them, or cut them into slivers.</li>
        <li>Once the water is boiling, go ahead and put the noodles in and set a timer.</li>
        <li>Now, take your chopped onions and sautee them in your olive oil. You want to bring the flavor out and turn them to a dark gold shade before adding the sauce.</li>
        <li>Once the onions are ready, go ahead and add the sauce. You'll want to chop the basil leaves up and add them to the sauce as well.</li>
        <li>Once the noodles are ready, take the lime and squeeze some of the juice into the sauce.<br>
        Now all you have to do is sauce the noodles and you're done!</li>
    </ol>
